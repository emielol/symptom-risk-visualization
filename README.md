# Diesase-Symptom Risk Visualization
## ✨ Overview
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/demo.gif" alt="App demo" width="800" />
</p>
This project is an end-to-end disease diagnosis and risk visualization system that allows users to:

- Select symptoms through an interactive UI

- Receive ranked disease predictions from a trained ML model

- Explore relative confidence levels via dynamic visualizations

- Inspect how individual symptoms contribute to predictions

The goal of this project is not only prediction, but interpretability and communication of model behavior.

## 📄 Technical Write‑Up

A full technical breakdown (data preprocessing, modeling assumptions, architecture decisions, limitations, and future improvements) is documented separately:

## 📊 Model Performance

- Accuracy: ~95% on held-out test data

- Trained on structured symptom–disease relationships

- Outputs normalized probabilities for UI clarity while preserving raw model probabilities for transparency


## 🧠 Key Features

- 🔍 Top‑K disease predictions (ranked)

- 📈 Interactive bar charts with hover tooltips

- 🧩 Symptom contribution analysis per prediction

- ⚡ Single-load model inference via Flask backend

- 🎨 Modern, responsive UI built with React + Recharts

## 🛠 Tech Stack

***Backend***
- Python
- Flask
- REST API architecture

***Machine Leaning***
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier
- Custom symptom feature encoding
- Probabilistic disease prediction (~95% accuracy)

***Frontend***
- React
- Node.js (development & build tooling)
- Recharts
- Tailwind

## 🚀 Running Locally

**Backend**
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m app
```

**Frontend**
```
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🧪 Example Workflow

1. User selects symptoms in the UI

2. Frontend sends symptom list to Flask API

3. Model generates Top‑K predictions

4. Backend returns:

    - Normalized confidence scores

    - Raw model probabilities

    - Symptom-level contribution data

5. Frontend renders results with interactive charts
